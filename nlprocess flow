nlprocess missing/stop/start/restart

Suppose we got an alert for a process missing inmail

First Scenario:
nlserver monitor -missing (If the process is positive, means missing then we will do the restart)
  This above case is not applicable to web because for web we need to follow other approach (apache restart and web restart)
    Web: If web is present on the monitor -missing command, Then we don't need to take core (gcore command is not needed)

Second Scenario:
We got an alert for a process missing but we don't find that in "nlserver monitor -missing" Then,
  We need to check if that has been restarted by watchdog to check if a process is restarted recently: "nlserver pdump -full <processname@instance_name>"
  By running above command we will know the time that it got an automatic restart. (If this Scenario is true then print a statement as " The watchdog restarted the process")

Third Scenario:
If above two Scenarios are not true that means it has been in a stuck state, That means we need to generate a gcore, We need to run command of (gcore <pid>) The pid for the gcore
can be obtained using nlserver pdump command
  Ex: neolane@clarins-rt-prod3-1:~$ nlserver pdump
      17:30:51 >   Application server for Adobe Campaign Classic (7.3.2 build 9356@0347232 of 11/10/2022)
      syslogd@default (841313) - 26.7 MB
      trackinglogd@default (845537) - 29.4 MB
      mta@clarins_rt_prod3 (845538) - 271.2 MB
      pipelined@clarins_rt_prod3 (845539) - 43.4 MB
      wfserver@clarins_rt_prod3 (845540) - 41.3 MB
      mtachild@clarins_rt_prod3 (1203234) - 62.6 MB
      web@default (845943) - 801.3 MB
      inMail@clarins_rt_prod3 (875773) - 45.1 MB
      watchdog (2833137) - 7.8 MB

And, then we will do the restart process, Once the restart has been completed we just need to make sure it is running. To do that "nlserver pdump -full <processname@instance_name>"
Print statement to be added as successfull restart for the process is done.
